## üñºÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Select your MTGA database file  
Locate your Arena install folder and choose the appropriate `Raw_CardDatabase... .mtga` database file.

**(Default installation path is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Wizards of the Coast```)**

or ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam``` 

or ```C:\Program Files\Epic Games``` 

depending on where you installed MTG Arena from 

![Database Selection](https://github.com/BobJr23/MTGA_Swapper/assets/98911103/d76fb165-cb32-447a-a27b-70719b292c9c)



---

### 2. Choose an export folder  
Pick where you want exported game assets (images) to be saved.

---

### 3. Browse card directory
Cards will appear in a list. Click one to preview the artwork and export the image with the Save button. (If art shows up as green marks, press "Next in bundle")

---

### 4. Edit game assets

After you have made edits to the card you would like, click on Change image, then select your new image file.

---

### 5. Upscaling Art
To increase image quality, press the upscale button (may take a few seconds). 

It is recommended to upscale the image **before** changing the aspect ratio to achieve the highest quality.


---

### 6. Set Aspect Ratio
Click the set aspect ratio button after opening the image if you would like to export them in their proper aspect ratio. 
- Note: If you would like to edit the asset in-game, don't change the aspect ratio, as Arena will change the ratio for you.

The aspect ratios are 

- 11:8 for most cards
- 3:4 for planeswalkers and larger art cards (Ex. Eldrazi)
- 4:3 for battles

---

### 7. Swap custom land art  
To unlock custom lands:

- Set a **normal** land (ArtSize = 0) as Swap 1
- Set a **custom** land (ArtSize = 2) as Swap 2  
- Hit **Swap Arts**
